+ LSTM Autoencoder Sensor Monitoring Dashboard
This dashboard is built with Streamlit and uses an LSTM autoencoder to monitor sensor behavior and detect anomalies in real-time. The model is trained on clean data where the sensor was working normally, and it's able to flag abnormal behavior in new files based on reconstruction error.

# What You Can Do With It
Upload a CSV file containing new sensor readings

See plots of raw signals for any selected feature

Track the model's reconstruction error and highlight abnormal segments

Pinpoint which sensor feature contributed most to each anomaly

View a breakdown of errors per feature to better understand how the system is behaving

Explore all anomalies in a clean, scrollable table

# How It Works
The core of the system is an LSTM autoencoder. It learns how the sensor normally behaves over time, and then compares that to incoming signals. If the model can't reconstruct the input well, it raises a flag — meaning the input doesn't match the expected pattern.

This works really well for subtle issues or early signs of failure that aren’t obvious to the eye.

# Input File Format
The dashboard accepts .csv files with time-series data from your sensor system.

It currently expects the following columns:

cur_1530, cur_1310

intpl_ntc_1530, intpl_ntc_1310

intpl_rawPd1, intpl_rawPd2

timeStamp (datetime format)

Make sure your timestamps are clean and consistent.
